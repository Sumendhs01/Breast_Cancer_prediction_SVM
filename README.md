# Breast_Cancer_prediction_SVM

The "Breast Cancer Prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVM)" project is a machine learning endeavor aimed at predicting breast cancer diagnosis with a high level of accuracy. The project leverages the power of Support Vector Machines, a robust classification algorithm, to develop a predictive model capable of distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors based on various features extracted from breast cancer biopsy data.

#Key Objectives

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a comprehensive dataset containing features extracted from breast cancer biopsies, such as cell nucleus characteristics, texture, and other relevant attributes. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalising features, and performing exploratory data analysis.

2. Feature Selection and Engineering: Identify the most relevant features that contribute to the classification task. Utilize domain knowledge and statistical techniques to select and engineer features that are most indicative of breast cancer types.

3. Model Development - SVM: Implement the Support Vector Machine algorithm for classification. Experiment with different SVM kernels (linear, radial basis function, polynomial) to find the best-fit model that maximises accuracy.

4. Model Training and Validation: Split the dataset into training and validation subsets. Train the SVM model on the training data and fine-tune hyperparameters using grid or random search techniques. Validate the model using cross-validation to ensure its robustness.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset. Measure key evaluation metrics such as accuracy, and confusion matrix to assess the model's ability to predict breast cancer accurately.
