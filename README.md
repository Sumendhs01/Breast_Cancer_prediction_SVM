# Breast_Cancer_prediction_SVM

The "Breast Cancer Prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVM)" project is a machine learning endeavor aimed at predicting breast cancer diagnosis with a high level of accuracy. The project leverages the power of Support Vector Machines, a robust classification algorithm, to develop a predictive model capable of distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors based on various features extracted from breast cancer biopsy data.
